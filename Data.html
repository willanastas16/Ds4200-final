            <h1>Data</h1>
            <p>The Polaris Data Insights Report and Global Estimates of Modern Slavery provide key contextual evidence and data to support our analysis of the CTDC dataset. Below are the insights, challenges, and actionable recommendations derived from this project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Cleaning Methods: Eliminating Excess Columns</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Original Data: 64 columns.</li>
                        <li>Ran into the issue of having too many types of exploitation, means of control columns.</li>
                        <li>Vast majority of the columns were binary, with 0 if not present, 1 if present, which made it harder to iterate through the dataset.</li>
                        <li>Means of Control and Type of Exploitation both have “Concatenated” value columns where a general category is given. Used these columns to put these categories into groups based on specific qualities.</li>
                        <li>Each category placed into a group with similar types of exploitation/means of control. Gives new columns based on the existing concatenated columns, with the new values being the assigned categories.</li>
                        <li>The new columns give us one concrete column for both of these important areas that can be used to determine which types of exploitation/means of control are most prevalent.</li>
                        <li>Creating a uniform column for recruitment types was a bit different, as many individuals had multiple recruitment types.</li>
                        <li>Function created that assigned the name of recruitment to the column if it was present, and assigned “Multiple Recruitment Methods” to those with more than one.</li>
                        <li>Created one uniform column to effectively iterate through each row and see which recruitment were most prevalent.</li>
                        <li>In the original data, we ran into issues with plotting the age of trafficking victims because they were listed in ranges, rather than as concrete numeric values (e.g., 00–08, rather than the victim’s actual age).</li>
                        <li>Ages were listed out of order due to this issue.</li>
                        <li>To fix this issue, midpoints for each range were created, and a new column was made to store these values. This allowed for ages to be listed in order to make it easier to understand what age groups are most at risk.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
