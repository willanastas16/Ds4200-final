                        pinpointing key years with significant increases or decreases. By showing trends over multiple
                        years, this visualization helps identify the impact of policy changes, awareness campaigns, or

                    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The stacked bar chart effectively shows how different genders are affected by
                        various exploitation types. It highlights stark disparities, such as females being
                        disproportionately affected by sexual exploitation and males being more prevalent in forced
                        labor. This visualization allows policymakers and organizations to design interventions based on
                        gender-specific vulnerabilities.</p>

                    <p>Means of Control Violin Plot: Means of Control vs. Percentages</p>
                    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The violin plot provides a detailed view of how different means of control are
                        distributed across trafficking cases. It reveals not only the most common methods, like
                        psychological abuse and physical control, but also the variability within each category. This
                        visualization is particularly useful for identifying nuanced patterns in how victims are controlled,
                        guiding tailored interventions.</p>

                    <p>Interactive Map: Clickable Country Data</p>
                    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The use of spatial regions and color hue is effective for showing geographic
                        disparities in trafficking. Users can explore specific countries to understand where reporting is
                        strong or lacking. This tool highlights areas for targeted intervention and international
                        collaboration.</p>

                    <p>Trafficking Incidents by Gender and Year</p>
                    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong>The interactive line plot provides a dynamic way to examine temporal trends in
                        trafficking incidents, filtered by gender. Users can identify spikes or declines in specific years
                        and compare patterns between genders. This visualization is particularly useful for evaluating
                        the effectiveness of gender-specific interventions or policies over time.</p>

                    <p>Interactive Stacked Bar Chart with Gender Breakdown</p>
                    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> The stacked bar chart allows us to visualize gender disparities within exploitation
                        types, with segments showing which gender is most affected by specific forms of trafficking.
                        This approach makes it easy to compare exploitation types and prioritize interventions for
                        vulnerable demographics. For example, females dominate sexual exploitation, while males are
                        more prevalent in forced labor.</p>

                    <p>Interactive Violin Plot - Test</p>
                    <p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> : The violin plot captures variability and density in the use of control methods,
                        showing the range and frequency of each method. Itâ€™s particularly useful for identifying which
                        controls are most frequently reported, such as psychological or physical abuse, and comparing
                        distributions across multiple categories. This helps stakeholders understand the multifaceted
                        vulnerabilities of trafficking victims.</p>
