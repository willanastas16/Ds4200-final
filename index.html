            <p>This project will focus on analyzing the human trafficking dataset provided by the Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC). We aim to understand the socio-demographic profiles of victims, the types of exploitation they experience, and the means of control used against them. The dataset captures information about gender, age, recruitment methods, and the various means by which victims are controlled, such as debt bondage, physical abuse, and restriction of movement.
                Human trafficking is a significant human rights issue that affects millions of individuals worldwide. By analyzing this dataset, we hope to uncover patterns that can help stakeholders such as NGOs and policymakers better understand the mechanisms of trafficking and identify risk factors. Insights gained from this analysis can potentially guide preventive measures, improve victim support systems, and raise public awareness about the conditions faced by trafficking victims.
                </p>

                The dataset used for this analysis is the Global K-anonymized Dataset from the Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC). It contains information on over 60 variables, including demographic profiles of victims (gender, age), details about the means of control used on victims (threats, physical abuse), and the type of exploitation involved (sexual exploitation, forced labor). The data has been collected by different organizations such as IOM, Polaris, and Liberty Shared. This dataset is suitable for our topic because it provides rich socio-demographic and exploitation-related details, making it possible to explore correlations and patterns in trafficking cases.
